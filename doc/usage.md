# Usage

## SMS notifications
**Free Mobile for PHP** provides the `FreeMobile\Client` class, which allow to send SMS messages to your mobile phone by using the `sendMessage()` method:

```php
<?php
use FreeMobile\{Client, ClientException};

try {
  $client = new Client('your account identifier', 'your API key');
  // For example: new Client('12345678', 'a9BkVohJun4MAf')

  $client->sendMessage('Hello World!');
  echo 'The message was sent successfully.';
}

catch (\Throwable $e) {
  echo 'An error occurred: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
  if ($e instanceof ClientException) echo 'From: ', $e->getUri(), PHP_EOL;
}
```

The `Client::sendMessage()` method throws an [`InvalidArgumentException`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/class.invalidargumentexception.php)
if the account credentials are invalid or if the specified message is empty. It throws a `FreeMobile\ClientException` if any error occurred while sending the message.

!!! warning
    The text of the messages will be automatically truncated to **160** characters:  
    you can't send multipart messages using this library.

## Client events
The `FreeMobile\Client` class is an [`EventEmitter`](https://github.com/igorw/evenement/blob/master/src/Evenement/EventEmitterInterface.php) that triggers some events during its life cycle:

- `Client::EVENT_REQUEST` : emitted every time a request is made to the remote service.
- `Client::EVENT_RESPONSE` : emitted every time a response is received from the remote service.

You can subscribe to them using the `on()` method:

```php
<?php
use FreeMobile\{Client};
use Psr\Http\Message\{RequestInterface, ResponseInterface};

$client->on(Client::EVENT_REQUEST, function(RequestInterface $request) {
  echo 'Client request: ', $request->getUri();
});

$client->on(Client::EVENT_RESPONSE, function($request, ResponseInterface $response) {
  echo 'Server response: ', $response->getStatusCode();
});
```

## Unit tests
If you want to run the library tests, you must set two environment variables:

```shell
export FREEMOBILE_USERNAME="your account identifier"
export FREEMOBILE_PASSWORD="your API key"
```

Then, you can run the `test` script from the command prompt:

```shell
composer test
```
